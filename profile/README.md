## 🚀 What is FundedNext Futures?

FundedNext Futures is the dedicated futures trading division of FundedNext — one of the largest and most trusted prop trading firms in the world, registered in the UAE and founded in March 2022 by CEO Abdullah Jayed. While FundedNext's CFD division has already funded over 364,000 traders and paid out more than $257 million in rewards globally, the Futures division brings that same institutional infrastructure — speed, transparency, and trader-first values — directly to the CME Group futures markets.

Unlike most prop firms that bolt on futures as an afterthought to their forex operations, FundedNext Futures was built from the ground up specifically for futures traders. It offers access to real CME Group pricing across a full range of futures instruments — indices (ES, NQ, YM), currencies, metals, energy, and agricultural contracts — with both mini and micro contract sizes available. Challenges start from just $79 for a $25,000 account and go up to $279 for a $100,000 account, with no activation fees, no monthly subscriptions, and a one-time-only evaluation cost. Once funded, traders receive a 100% profit split — keeping every dollar of their earnings — with a 24-hour payout guarantee backed by a $1,000 cash compensation pledge if FundedNext ever misses that window.

## 💼 Why Choose FundedNext Futures Over Other Prop Firms?

FundedNext Futures has built a reputation as one of the most transparent, fast-paying, and trader-first futures prop firms operating in 2026. Here is what sets it apart:

- **Real CME Group pricing** — all futures instruments are priced directly from CME Group exchanges, giving traders genuine market conditions rather than simulated spread environments
- **100% profit split once funded** — keep every single dollar you earn on your funded futures account, with no percentage withheld
- **24-hour payout guarantee with $1,000 penalty** — if FundedNext misses the 24-hour withdrawal window for any reason not caused by incorrect trader details, a $1,000 cash compensation is automatically paid — one of the strongest payout accountability pledges in the futures prop industry
- **15% performance bonus on challenge profits** — uniquely, FundedNext rewards traders for profits made during the evaluation phase itself, not just after funding — a rare and meaningful incentive
- **No time limits** — complete the 1-Phase evaluation entirely at your own pace with no deadline pressure whatsoever
- **No activation fees** — pay once for the challenge and nothing more; no monthly subscriptions, no software fees, no hidden costs after passing
- **No daily drawdown restriction** — only an end-of-day balance-based maximum loss limit applies, giving traders meaningful intraday breathing room during volatile sessions
- **Contract scaling system** — as your FundedNext account balance grows post-challenge, your contract size limits automatically increase based on end-of-day performance, rewarding consistency with proportionally more trading power
- **Payout cycle every 5 days** — one of the most frequent payout cycles of any futures prop firm globally, with benchmark days required to trigger eligibility
- **Benchmark day system** — 5 benchmark days required before first payout on the $25K account ($100 per day closed profit), and 5 days on larger accounts ($200 per day)
- **News trading fully permitted** — trade freely through any high-impact economic event, including NFP, CPI, FOMC, and other major releases, with no restrictions or buffers
- **Mini and micro contracts available** — both E-mini and micro contract sizes are supported, giving traders at every account level flexibility in position sizing
- **Wide futures instrument range** — equity indices (ES, NQ, YM, RTY), currencies, metals (GC, SI), energies (CL, NG), agricultural contracts, and more via CME Group
- **Three professional platforms** — trade on Tradovate, NinjaTrader, or TradingView, three of the most respected and widely used futures trading platforms in the professional community
- **Account resets available** — if you breach the rules during evaluation, reset your account at a 10% discount rather than repurchasing from scratch
- **83/100 independent score** — ranked among the top futures prop firms in 2026 by CBS News and FuturePropFirms.us for pricing transparency, payout speed, and trading conditions
- **Backed by FundedNext's global infrastructure** — $257M+ in total payouts, 93,000+ funded traders, and a 4.5 out of 5 rating on Trustpilot from over 55,000 verified reviews across the entire FundedNext ecosystem
